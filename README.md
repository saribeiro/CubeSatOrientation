# CubeSatOrientation
This is a MATLAB project to determine the orientation of a CubeSat based on the light falling on the faces of the CubeSat.
This project is for the fulfillment of course requirements for ECE 580 (Spring 2022) at George Mason University for Dr. Piotr Pachowicz.

Our project is divided into the following directories,

1. Data
2. ECE580_FinalReport
3. Figures
4. MATLAB_Code

All of the code we run is in directory 4. The output results from directory 4 go into directory 1. Any figures that you want to save from the code
results are saved into directory 3. The final LaTeX report submitted for the class is in directory 2. Directory 2 may be useful for a developer to
look at if they would like to understand the mathematical model that was used to model this situation.
